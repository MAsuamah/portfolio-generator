* Once the appropriate modules are installed, run the command `node app.js` to start the program.
* Fill out the prompts in the command line.
* Once the prompts are completed, index.html and style.css files will be created in the dist folder in the portfolio-generator root.
* You can now navigate to the dist folder and open index.html to see the generated portfolio. It will look something like this:
