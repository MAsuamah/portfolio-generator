# Portfolio Generator

Generate a simple portfolio for your work that will include: 
* Your Name 
* An about you section
* Titles of your projects 
* Descriptions of your projects 
* Links to your projects.

## How to Install
* Clone this repository onto your local machine in a location of your choice. See [How to Clone a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) if needed.
* `cd` into the portfolio-generator folder.
* Run the command `npm install` in your terminal while in the root of the portfolio-generator folder. This will install the appropriate node modules needed to run the program.

## How To Use
* Once the appropriate modules are installed, run the command `node app.js` to start the program.
* Fill out the prompts in the command line.
* Once the prompts are completed, index.html and style.css files will be created in the dist folder in the portfolio-generator root.
* You can now navigate to the dist folder and open index.html to see the generated portfolio. It will look something like this:
